## Population Dynamics of the California Condor

The California condor has been the focus of intensive conservation efforts since the 1980s, when the wild population dropped below 30 individuals. The current recovery strategy relies on two major components:

1. **Captive breeding and staged releases**, providing a reliable recruitment source.
2. **Management of anthropogenic mortality**, primarily lead poisoning from ingested ammunition fragments.

Scientific literature provides age-specific survival rates, fecundity estimates, and risk parameters that form the foundation of mechanistic population models. These models often include:
- Age-structured Leslie or Lefkovitch matrices  
- Density-dependent effects  
- Lead-exposure mortality models  
- Catastrophic event modules

However, most models operate under fixed management policies and cannot adaptively optimize decisions.

## Management Policies for Endangered Species

Traditional management approaches rely on:
- Expert heuristics  
- Static release quotas  
- Periodic mitigation interventions  
- Numerical simulations for scenario comparison  

While effective in many contexts, these approaches:
- Do not optimize sequential decisions under long-term uncertainty  
- Cannot automatically trade off costs and benefits  
- Provide limited guidance on real-time policy adjustment  

This motivates the search for adaptive, data-driven management tools.
