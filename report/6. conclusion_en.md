# Conclusion

This project demonstrates the feasibility of applying reinforcement learning to endangered species management using the California condor as a case study.

Key achievements include:

1. Developing a calibrated age-structured ecological model  
2. Reproducing historical population trends  
3. Training an offline RL agent using Fitted Q-Iteration  
4. Visualizing policy structures with trajectories, phase portraits, KDE, hexbin, and 2D heatmaps  
5. Interpreting RL policies through ecological principles  

Our findings reveal that:

- RL learns cost-efficient strategies under strong ecological dynamics  
- Population remains stable except for rare disasters  
- Policies are multi-modal and weakly state-dependent  
- RL-generated strategies are biologically plausible and robust  

This work serves as a foundation for future RL-based conservation tools.
